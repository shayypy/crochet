Simple blogtype website mostly for crochet related things. I made this in anticipation of needing somewhere to publish a pattern.

## Attribution

Thanks to Rafael Pedicini for publishing [spa-github-pages](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) (MIT), a very helpful template for single-page apps that I was able to adapt for this site.
